I am a disease ecologist interested in how we can use pathogen surveillance data and apply tools from graph theory in a novel way, to better understand broad scale spatial transmission of multi-host disease systems. My dissertation research focuses on quantifying spatial patterns of prevalence, and modeling the international movement of avian influenza viruses via migratory waterfowl.
