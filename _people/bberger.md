As a disease ecologist, I see myself at the interface of empirical data collection and data analysis where I can broaden general ecological knowledge and inform strategies to manage disease outbreaks and conserve wildlife populations. I am interested in how host population dynamics, biodiversity, and human disturbance alter patters of pathogen persistence and emergence across landscapes.
