I work in the field of veterinary wildlife disease ecology, researching factors that drive disease spread and severity, with interests in One Health systems that integrate human, animal, and environmental health. I am interested in scaling individual health processes to predict population levels of mortality. In my thesis work I focus on how host-environment interactions influence disease outcome by using metabolic models to predict bat mortality from white nose syndrome as a function of spatiotemporal microclimate measurements in hibernation.
