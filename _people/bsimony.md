I am a masters student in the Webb Lab, with a background in mathematics, and I am interested in using computational approaches to model disease outbreaks and characterize the drivers of transmission. My work has focused on within-herd modeling of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in livestock and wildlife. Currently, I am interested in characterizing bTB outbreaks in wild deer populations to inform management strategies to reduce wildlife disease prevalence and the potential for spillover into livestock populations.
