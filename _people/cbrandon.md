I joined the Webb Lab in 2024 after several years working as a disease ecologist at the University of Georgia, where I focused on natural systems. As a PhD student, I'm now expanding my quantitative skillset to better understand disease dynamics in agricultural settings. My current research uses national-scale simulations to explore which livestock disease outbreak origin points are most likely to cause large-scale epidemics, which control strategies are most effective at curbing their spread, and which drivers of disease outbreaks are most important.
