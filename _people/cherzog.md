I am an epidemiologist and quantitative infectious disease ecologist with experience working abroad (Egypt, Zambia, Tanzania, Ethiopia) and domestically (Military Health System) on interdisciplinary teams. I am interested in emerging, infectious pathogens of humans and animals and working in multi-host disease systems. My dissertation research focused on establishing epidemiological patterns, risk factors, and parameters as well as dynamical modeling of peste des petits ruminants virus dynamics among sheep, goats, and cattle in northern Tanzania. I continued to explore the role of cattle in PPRV transmission in my first postdoc through experimental transmission trials in Ethiopia. I am starting to work on cattle and swine movements in the US and their impact on disease spread.
