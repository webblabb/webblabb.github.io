I am an epidemiologist and quantitative infectious disease ecologist with experience working abroad (Egypt, Zambia, Tanzania, Ethiopia) and domestically (Military Health System) on interdisciplinary teams. I am interested in emerging, infectious pathogens of humans and animals and working in multi-host disease systems. My dissertation research focused on establishing epidemiological patterns, risk factors, and parameters as well as dynamical modeling of peste des petits ruminants virus dynamics among sheep, goats, and cattle in northern Tanzania. I continued to explore the role of cattle in PPRV transmission in my first postdoc through experimental transmission trials in Ethiopia. In Webb lab, I work on developing and/or using statistical and mathematical models of domestic livestock (cattle and swine) movement networks, wildlife movement networks (avian influenza), and am a Co-Primary Investigator on collaborative vector-borne disease research of cattle fever ticks at the livestock-wildlife interface with the USDA and the Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program. Additionally, I continue involvement in the VectorBiTE research coordination network and the FAO/OIE PPRV Global Research and Expertise Network.
