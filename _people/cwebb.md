I am broadly interested in the evolution of traits important in ecological interactions and in how such evolution shapes communities and ecosystems. For example, I investigate how selective processes on traits determine community and ecosystem function responses to environmental change. I am also interested in the evolution and ecology of highly virulent diseases in the context of persistence. I work in a number of different systems and use a variety of analytical and simulation methods.
