I am broadly interested in the evolution of traits important in ecological interactions and in how evolution shapes communities and ecosystems.  I also seek to do work with applied meaning.  For example, I am interested in how highly virulent pathogens persist as well as understanding the drivers of spatio-temporal spread in pathogen-host systems in order to inform management decisions.  I have also worked on a number of conservation issues as well as how selective processes on traits determine community and ecosystem function responses to environmental change.  I work in a number of different empirical systems and use a variety of analytical and simulation methods.
