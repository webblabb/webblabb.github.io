I am a quantitative disease ecologist with broad interests in disease dynamics, wildlife health, and conservation.  My work combines host ecology or community ecology to understand infection dynamics. My current work investigates the national-scale spread of avian influenza in wild waterfowl in collaboration with scientists at the USDA and USGS.
