# I study the structure and function of food webs in order to
# better understand our environment and the dynamics of biological
# complexity. I’m interested in topics in theoretical ecology and
# population biology which explore how biodiversity affects ecological
# systems. As well, I’m interested in where the ideas and methods of
# theoretical ecology come from, and how they are applied. As such,
# though my work foregrounds theory and computational approaches, my
# research shows how theoretical insights resonate with empirical
# knowledge and ecological understanding. This connection between
# ecosystems we observe and theories which help us make sense of and
# manage them, is reflected in projects I have worked on collaboratively
# that apply a range of approaches (theory, quantitative, field and lab)
# to grasslands and aquatic systems.
