I study the structure and function of food webs in order to
better understand our environment and the dynamics of biological
complexity. I’m interested in topics in theoretical ecology and
population biology which explore how biodiversity affects ecological
systems. As well, I’m interested in where the ideas and methods of
theoretical ecology come from, and how they are applied. As such,
though my work foregrounds theory and computational approaches, my
research shows how theoretical insights resonate with empirical
knowledge and ecological understanding. This connection between
ecosystems we observe and theories which help us make sense of and
manage them, is reflected in projects I have worked on collaboratively
that apply a range of approaches (theory, quantitative, field and lab)
to grasslands and aquatic systems.
