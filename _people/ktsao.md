I think parasitism is brilliant. I get particularly excited when studying factors driving pathogen transmission among communities, which often include wildlife, vectors, domestic animals, and
# occasionally humans, as well as the consequent effects on pathogen evolution. My approach to exploring these issues has included wildlife trapping, analyzing genetic data, and simulating transmission processes via computer programs. I am currently focused on analyzing a large dataset of cattle shipments and pathogen genetic data to better understand transmission in the context of contact networks.
