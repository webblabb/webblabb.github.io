I am a disease ecologist, interested in the effect of environmental and population drivers of disease dynamics. I use data driven theoretical methods to explore questions about the influence of populations on disease risk or spread. My PhD research focused on the impact of environmental temperature on mosquito population dynamics and the potential for malaria transmission. I am currently working on a collaborative project exploring the spatial movement patterns of cattle in the United States and the effect these could have on disease spread.
