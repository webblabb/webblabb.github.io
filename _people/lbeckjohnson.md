I am a disease ecologist, broadly interested in understanding and forecasting infectious disease dynamics across scales. I use a variety of data-driven theoretical methods to explore questions about how certain factors (e.g. abiotic and biotic conditions, population demography and movement patterns, and interventions), operating at different spatial and temporal scales influence the population-level dynamics of infectious diseases. Currently, my primary effort is focused on several international collaborative livestock disease projects to develop ensemble forecasting methodologies, explore outbreak variability, and the effect of movement patterns, infrastructure and demography on potential outbreaks and the effectiveness of response actions in the United States. In addition, I collaborate on several smaller projects involving human vector-borne disease and the livestock-wildlife disease interface.
