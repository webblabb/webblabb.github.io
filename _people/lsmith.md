I am a recent Master of Public Health graduate with a broad background in animal science, infectious disease, epidemiology, data analytics, and agricultural economics. My long-term goal is to integrate these concepts through a One Health framework and applied data science. Specifically, I am interested looking at environmental factors (e.g. climate change, deforestation) that impact the human population through the agricultural industry (e.g. livestock disease outbreaks) and at the wildlife-domestic-human zoonotic interface. Highlights from my prior research include the development of an African Swine Fever model for destination and origin of swine-origin product, modeling the impacts of weather on parasite load in rams to investigate genetic heat resistance, and involvement in several HIV and cancer studies in non-human primates. In Webb lab I work on the Colorado FMD Cattle project, where I am pursuing my research interests and gaining new skills in disease ecology and disease outbreak modeling.
