<!--
I am a senior analyst and ecologist with United States Department of Agriculture Center for Epidemiology and Animal Health. I am broadly interested in landscape and population ecology, with special interests in disease ecology and conservation biology. Specifically, I am interested in the mechanisms that drive contact and transmission of pathogens at the wildlife-livestock interface.  Furthermore, I am interested in how policy can be established to mitigate transmission. Specific systems I study include the cervid-cattle interface, feral swine-livestock interface, and wild bird-domestic fowl interface.
