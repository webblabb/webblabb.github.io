I am joining the Webb Lab as plant community ecologist and an aspiring disease ecologist. My previous work aimed broadly to understand factors influencing plant community composition in a variety of ecosystems, and whether leaf, stem, and root traits could explain those community dynamics. I hope to apply my interest in traits to disease systems to assess the risk of disease outbreak and spread.
