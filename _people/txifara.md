# I am a Postdoctoral Fellow appointed jointly with National Wildlife Research Center. I am currently working on statistical models for estimating elimination probability of rabies across the vaccination barrier and I am also developing statistical models for estimating key parameters of populations and disease transmission. Before coming here I was a visiting Assistant Professor at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at University of California Santa Cruz. My research interests lie on Bayesian and computational statistics with applications in real-life problems including disease and global change ecology, epidemiology and osteoarchaeology. I received my PhD in Statistics from Lancaster University, UK, where part of my funding was from the National Center for Zoonosis Research.
